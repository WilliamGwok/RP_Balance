### Core Code
#### Balancing Chassis Modeling
Formulate and simplify dynamic and kinematic equations, calculate system A, B matrices.

|---|---|---|
| Centroid | Solve for centroid coordinates and moments of inertia of the links | [.m](https://github.com/WilliamGwok/RP_Balance/blob/main/MatlabWorks/SJTU_Model/Model/Centroid.m) |
| Five_Link_Base | Solve for angle relationships and virtual force calculations | [.m](https://github.com/WilliamGwok/RP_Balance/blob/main/MatlabWorks/SJTU_Model/Model/Five_Link_Base.m) |

#### LQR Controller and K Matrix Fitting
The wheeled chassis uses a five-link structure with adjustable leg lengths. As the leg length changes, the chassis model changes, requiring the fitting coefficients of the K matrix relative to leg length.

| Code | Description | File Link |
|---|---|---|
| Master | Main fitting function | [.m](https://github.com/WilliamGwok/RP_Balance/blob/main/MatlabWorks/SJTU_Model/K_L_Fitting/Master.m) |
| Func_Cal_K | K matrix calculations | [.m](https://github.com/WilliamGwok/RP_Balance/blob/main/MatlabWorks/SJTU_Model/K_L_Fitting/Func_Cal_K.m) |

#### System A, B Matrix Fitting and MPC-Like Control
To address instability when the robotâ€™s drive wheels encounter abrupt resistance (on smooth or uneven surfaces), an MPC-inspired approach is used. It predicts the robot's state at the next moment based on its current state and input, compensating the output torque of the drive wheels for the difference between the predicted and actual state. 

Since A and B matrices also require fitting, this method is implemented accordingly.

## Debugging Challenges

#### Persistent Motor Protection Issues
Due to hardware limitations in 2024, motors were frequently burned during testing, sometimes even catching fire. A more stable protection system was eventually implemented with the help of experienced team members. Additional hardware failures occurred during competitions due to wire insulation damage.

#### Motor Damage
Inexperience among new mechanical team members led to issues such as using printed components to mount motors, which deformed during use and caused screws to penetrate motor windings during maintenance.
